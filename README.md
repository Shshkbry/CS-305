# CS-305
### Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
My client, Artemis Financial, is a firm that offers financial services. Their software requirements entailed secure data handling techniques that would keep them compliant with the Gramm Leech Bliley Act. In addition, they were seeking advice on their current security measures.
### What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
Code security is essential for a company's well-being, shielding against data breaches, maintaining customer trust, and ensuring legal compliance. Secure coding practices protect sensitive information, prevent financial losses, and minimize downtime from cyberattacks. They also safeguard intellectual property, adapt to evolving threats, and enhance brand reputation. Beyond technical necessity, secure coding is a strategic investment in risk management and customer confidence, emphasizing a commitment to software integrity and security.
### What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The Maven Dependency check was hard to understand at first, but I did find it helpful eventually. 
### How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I improved security by updating old software and adding stronger encryption for sensitive data from clients. Moving forward, I'll use Dependency Check to find vulnerabilities and decide on ways to fix them.
### How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I ran the Maven Dependency check again to make sure no new vulnerabilities were introduced. Unfortunately, I still had new ones and I couldn't quite figure out what mistakes I was making.
### What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The OWASP website will definitely be useful in my future assignments.
### Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I'm not convinced I did anything unique here.
